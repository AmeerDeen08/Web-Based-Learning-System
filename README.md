# 🎓 Web-Based Learning System

## Overview

This beginner-level full stack project focuses on developing an interactive **web-based learning platform**. It enables users (students and educators) to **create, upload, browse, and access learning materials**, providing a simulated environment for building educational tech solutions.

Students will learn to structure role-based access, manage digital content, and handle secure user interactions — essential elements in today's digital education landscape.

---

## 🚀 Goals of the Project

* Understand the design of a learning management system (LMS).
* Learn user roles: student vs teacher (and permissions).
* Implement file upload, preview, and download features.
* Build protected routes and session-based access control.
* Develop APIs to manage learning content (notes, videos, quizzes, etc.).
* Practice fullstack integration and collaborative workflows.

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

> 📌 *The final tech stack will be discussed as a team.*
> Some recommended options:

* Frontend: React.js / HTML-CSS-JS
* Backend: Node.js with Express / Django / Flask
* Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL
* Authentication: JWT / Sessions
* File Upload: Multer / Django File Storage / Firebase
* Deployment: Render / Railway / Netlify / Vercel
* Version Control: Git + GitHub

---

## 🧱 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup

* Plan user roles and permissions (teacher/student).
* Setup repo, folder structure, and tech stack.
* Design wireframes for dashboards and upload pages.

### Phase 2: Authentication System

* Create user registration and login for both roles.
* Add role-based access control (RBAC).
* Use session or JWT-based protection.

### Phase 3: Notes and Content Upload

* Allow educators to upload notes or video URLs.
* Store metadata (title, description, subject).
* Implement file validations and limit formats.

### Phase 4: Student View and Downloads

* Build dashboard for students to browse/download.
* Add filters (by subject, file type, teacher).
* Implement download count tracking or preview if needed.

### Phase 5: UI/UX Enhancements

* Responsive design for all devices.
* Dark/light mode switch (optional).
* Add progress indicators and animations.

## 📢 Contribution Guidelines

This guide walks you through how to **fork**, **clone**, **write code**, and **create a Pull Request (PR)** to contribute to the official Nexus Club fullstack project repository.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Visit the main project repository link shared by the mentor.
2. Click the **"Fork"** button on the top-right corner.
3. GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your account.

> 🛠 You’ll now have your own copy where you can push your changes safely.

---

## 💻 Step 2: Clone Your Fork Locally

1. Copy the HTTPS clone URL of your fork
   Example:

   ```
   https://github.com/your-username/web-based-learning-system.git
   ```
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-based-learning-system.git
   cd web-based-learning-system
   ```

---

## 🌿 Step 3: Create a New Branch

Always create a new branch for every new feature or fix.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

> Example: `feature/upload-material` or `bugfix/login-auth-error`

---

## 🧑‍💻 Step 4: Make Changes

Now you're free to code!
Modify files, add new ones, or build your assigned module.

✅ Keep your code clean and readable.
✅ Test everything before committing.

---

## 💾 Step 5: Commit Your Changes

Once you're done:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added: upload notes module for teachers"
```

---

## 🚀 Step 6: Push Your Branch to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

---

## 📬 Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. You’ll see a banner to create a **Pull Request** — click it.
3. Choose the **base repository** (main club repo) and the branch (`main`) to merge into.
4. Add a **clear title** and **description** of what you’ve done.
5. Click **"Create Pull Request"**.

Wait for the mentor or Fullstack Lead to review your changes and give feedback or approve it for merging.

---

## 🔁 Step 8: Stay Updated with the Main Repo

To avoid conflicts, regularly sync your fork with the main repo.

### Add the main repository as upstream (only once):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nexus-club/web-based-learning-system.git
```

### Pull the latest changes:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

Now continue from Step 3 again if you want to work on a new feature.

---

## 🙌 Final Notes

* Pull the latest changes before starting any task.
* Don’t push directly to the `main` branch.
* Maintain clear commit messages.
* Ping your Fullstack Lead or mentor for any confusion.
